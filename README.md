# Convected Dubins C++ Library

Convected Dubins paths are time-optimal paths planned in a known, steady, uniform wind. The algorithm is based on the paper by L. Techy and C. Woolsey referenced below.

## Dependencies:
- Ubuntu 16.04
- cmake
- (Optional) Octave/MATLAB
  for generating .m files for plotting

## Build instructions:
- Run `./build.sh` to create a library in `./lib` and executables in `./bin`

## Usage instructions:
- See test programs in `./programs` for examples of how to incorporate into your own code
- `clean.sh` removes all compiled files, build files, and temporary files
